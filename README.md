# AWS Name Generator

The names of AWS [Cloud Products](https://aws.amazon.com/products/) are, frankly, very bad. They [should have used more clear names](https://expeditedsecurity.com/aws-in-plain-english/) for almost everything.

In that spirit, you can now generate your very own AWS product name. Enjoy.
